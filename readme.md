# Archon

Built with Forerunner technology.

## History

Originally developed by Grenadiac in C++ for Windows, Sparkedit's source was given to bobindashadows,
who began porting the application to OS X. Next, Fred Havemayer aka 'Sword' rebranded the project as
Swordedit. Most recently, the project has been taken up by Samuco, under the new name Archon.
